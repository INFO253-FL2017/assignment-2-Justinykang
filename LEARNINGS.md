1. What is the function of the following technologies in your assignment:
    - HTML
        - The HTML is like the bones of the website \- creating structure and organization. It also deals with some of the styling; however, most of the functionality is in creating different divisions and sections in the code to partition different parts of the website.
    - CSS
        - CSS is the main driver of the styling of the presentation of the website, including colors, fonts, and layouts. It is like the f-ace of the website.
    - JavaScript
        - JavaScript is the muscles of the website, powering the motion and interactivity of the page. It supports procedural and object oriented programming, bringing together the client side of the browser with server side programs.
    - Python
        - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is utilized to create a webpage, but to connect all these things to web frameworks, such as Flask, we need to utilize Python \- it connects a webpage on your local machine to a webserver (which could also just be on your local machine).
    - Flask
        - Flask is a web framework, which provides you with the tools and libraries to build a web application. It is written in Python, which is why we need Python to connect these tools to our webpage.
    - HTTP
        - HTTP is a protocol to organize/standardize the way we communicate data through the World Wide Web. It is designed for the client-server computing model that is widely used today.
    - GET and POST requests
        - POST request methods request that a web server accept data enclosed in the body of the message \- basically ways of "sending" data to the server. On the other hand, GET request methods retrieve information from the server.


2. How does HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together in the browser for this assignment?
    - Each page corresponds to an HTML page with each parts of the page structured and organized. Some pages or even sections of the HTML files are styled by CSS files. In addition to that, some pages or sections are more interactive with the client side, which means that a user visiting the website could give the client some input to the server and the server could respond, and this is all powered by the JavaScript files.


3. How does Python and Flask work together in the server for this assignment?
    - We use Python to call on the libraries and methods provided by Flask. Python also connects the HTML files to the Flask methods.


4. List all of the possible GET and POST requests that your server returns a response for and describes what happens for each GET and POST request
    - The client uses a POST request to give information from the contact form to the server. The server then responds by sending an email through Maingun.
